# SERVERLESS WEB APPLICATION
Application development built on a serverless system scale automatically with usage, regardless of how high or low the usage is at any given time. The impact of sudden, high user loads is reduced as the serverless architecture scales up and down at any level. Serverless architecture allows development teams to focus on quality code development instead of managing deployments and code within a cloud system
